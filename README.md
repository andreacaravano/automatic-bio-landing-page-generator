# Automatic Bio Landing Page generator

This repository contains some of the files used by my Automatic Bio Landing Page generator to produce a Zip compressed archive, containing the HTML page and resources needed to publish the page everywhere you want, online.

# How can I generate mine?

The easiest way, of course, is to use this link, where you will be able to directly insert your profile URLs and e-mail to generate your Bio Landing Page automatically.  
You will only have to change the default Profile Photo with yours, if you'd like to.

# Can I generate mine manually?

Yes, of course.  
In fact, I have prepared a PHP page, in which, at the beginning, I placed the same parameters you are able to manage using the Web Application.  
Naturally, if you execute the PHP code locally, you are then able to transform it into static HTML using the code generated by PHP or doing it manually, if you prefer static pages.
  
You will find it into the *PHP Code* folder.

# How does it work?

To guarantee a good level of security, I won't publish the Web Application source code, as it can be used to attack the Server, using potential vulnerabilities.  
  
Basically, after validating the pieces of information sent by the user, the application produces a file based on the parameters received, which is then put in a Zip archive, with the CSS and HTML code required, as well as some SVG images, representing Social Networks logos.  
The images chosen have been taken from IconFinder and they are signed as freely redistributable, but they are not thought to be sold.

## What about privacy?

As explained in the previous section, for security reasons, I can't publish the Web Application source code, but I assure you that the Server automatically deletes users' Zip archive immediately after download, not only to save space, but also because I really don't want to steal your data in any way.
